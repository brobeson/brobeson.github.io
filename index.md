  I worked on the EP2 software which powers the [EP-80](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/Military-And-Defense/Simulation-And-Training/Products-And-Services/Image-Generation-Displays-Projectors/Ep-80-Image-Generation-System), and [EP-8100](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/Military-And-Defense/Simulation-And-Training/Products-And-Services/Image-Generation-Displays-Projectors/Ep-8100) image generators.
  I was the lead engineer for the environment component.
  This component is responsible for animating and rendering environment effects such as the sky, clouds, sun, and weather.
